This project is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that functions as a movie and TV browsing app. 
It allows users to explore a dynamic home screen, utilize a powerful search feature, view detail screens with YouTube trailers, and download titles for offline viewing using SwiftData. 
The app integrates with The Movie Database and YouTube APIs to provide its content. 
It serves as a comprehensive guide for building an iOS app from scratch, covering essentials like networking, API integration, navigation, and modern data storage.
